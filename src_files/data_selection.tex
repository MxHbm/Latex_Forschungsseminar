\chapter{Comparison of Available Datasets}
\label{sec:dataset_selection}

This chapter builds upon the insights elaborated in previous chapters to lay the foundation
for developing a classifier for the \cgls{3L-CVRP} with practical constraints by comparing and
selecting a suitable dataset. The classifier will be used to predict the feasibility of packing a
given set of cuboids into a vehicle - representing a single tour - similar to the approach presented
in Chapter~\ref{sec:motivation_feasibility_prediction} by \citeauthor{zhang_learning-based_2022}.

As discussed in Chapter~\ref{sec:classical_solution_approaches}, the \gls{CLP} is an NP-hard problem,
making it computationally demanding to verify the packing feasibility of individual routes.
A classifier can therefore enhance the performance of existing exact algorithms \footcite[cf.][]{tamke_branch-and-cut_2024}
by reducing the need to compute feasibility exactly - using \cgls{CP} methods - only when a
final solution is found, or just before columns generated in Branch-and-Price or Branch-and-Cut
algorithms are discarded \footcite[cf.][pp. 9--11]{zhang_learning-based_2022}. As many single routes
need to be evaluated this use case has the potential to significantly reduce the overall
computation time. First, several published \cgls{3L-CVRP} datasets will be compared with respect
to their overall characteristics. Subsequently, a more detailed analysis will focus on the
heterogeneity of the items. Finally, a suitable dataset will be selected as a promising foundation
for developing a classifier.
