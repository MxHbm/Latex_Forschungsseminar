\label{sec:introduction}
In todayâ€™s globalized economy, efficient logistics networks are vital for managing the vast number of
goods transported daily. Maritime shipping, responsible for about $80\%$ of global trade,
forms a backbone of this network. \footcite[cf.][]{un_trade_and_development_unctad_review_2024}
However, the last mile, delivering individual parcels to customers, poses some of the most complex optimization
challenges. In 2022, over 161 billion parcels were delivered globally, equating to more than 5,000
deliveries every second.\footcite[cf.][]{statista_global_2022}
These numbers are only manageable through a strong logistics network, where even small inefficiencies
become very costly and optimization potential is huge. Two major challenges are faced in this domain, which
is the optimization of the routes driven by the delivery trucks, the \gls{VRP}, and the efficient arrangement of items
of various shapes and sizes, the \gls{CLP}. When the \gls{VRP} and the \gls{CLP} are solved integrated,
solutions are on average around $7\%$ better cost-wise, but are complex to solve as
both problems are NP-hard. \footcite[cf.][p. 23]{cote_value_2016} Therefore, efficient heuristics are the practical
choice to find good solutions in a reasonable time, because exact solution methods are limited to
small instances considering only few practical constaints, as orientation rules, stability, and load-bearing limits. \footcite[cf.][pp. 377--378]{bischoff_issues_1995}
Recent research has shown that \gls{ML} techniques can be used to accelerate the exact solution process
of the \gls{2L-CVRP}.\footcite[cf.][]{zhang_learning-based_2022}
Therefore this paper aims to provide an overview of the \gls{CLP} and explore how \gls{ML} can be used
to enhance the solution process of \gls{CLP} algorithms focusing on the \gls{3L-CVRP}.
The paper is structured as follows:
Chapter~\ref{sec:clp_definition} introduces the \gls{CLP} and its common constraints.
Chapter~\ref{sec:classical_solution_approaches} outlines exact and heuristic algorithms.
Chapter~\ref{sec:motivation_feasibility_prediction} presents recent research on integrating \gls{ML}
models to improve solution quality and speed. Chapter~\ref{sec:dataset_selection} compares suitable datasets
for training a classifier for the constrained \gls{3L-CVRP}. Finally, Chapter~\ref{sec:conclusion}
summarizes the insights and discusses future work in feasibility prediction for the \gls{3L-CVRP}.
