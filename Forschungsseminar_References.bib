  abstract     = {Container loading is a pivotal function for operating supply chains efficiently. Underperformance results in unnecessary costs (e.g. cost of additional containers to be shipped) and in an unsatisfactory customer service (e.g. violation of deadlines agreed to or set by clients). Thus, it is not surprising that container loading problems have been dealt with frequently in the operations research literature. It has been claimed though that the proposed approaches are of limited practical value since they do not pay enough attention to constraints encountered in practice. In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art in the field of container loading will be given. We will identify factors which ‚Äì from a practical point of view ‚Äì need to be considered when dealing with container loading problems and we will analyze whether and how these factors are represented in methods for the solution of such problems. Modeling approaches, as well as exact and heuristic algorithms will be reviewed. This will allow for assessing the practical relevance of the research which has been carried out in the field. We will also mention several issues which have not been dealt with satisfactorily so far and give an outlook on future research opportunities.},

The vehicles have a two-dimensional loading surface and a maximum weight capacity. The aim is to find a partition of the customers into routes of minimum total cost such that, for each vehicle, the weight capacity is taken into account and a feasible two-dimensional allocation of the items into the loading surface exists.

  abstract     = {Abstract
                  Given automated order systems, detailed characteristics of items and vehicles enable the detailed planning of deliveries including more efficient and safer loading of distribution vehicles. Many vehicle routing approaches ignore complex loading constraints. This paper focuses on the comprehensive evaluation of loading constraints in the context of combined Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and 3D Loading (3L-{CVRP}) and its extension with time windows (3L-{VRPTW}). To the best of our knowledge, this paper considers the currently largest number of loading constraints meeting real-world requirements and reducing unnecessary loading efforts for both problem variants. We introduce an approach for the load bearing strength of items ensuring a realistic load distribution between items. Moreover, we provide a new variant for the robust stability constraint enabling better performance and higher stability. In addition, we consider axle weights of vehicles to prevent overloaded axles for the first time for the 3L-{VRPTW}. Additionally, the reachability of items, balanced loading and manual unloading of items are taken into account. All loading constraints are implemented in a deepest-bottom-left-fill algorithm, which is embedded in an outer adaptive large neighbourhood search tackling the Vehicle Routing Problem. A new set of 600 instances is created, published and used to evaluate all loading constraints in terms of solution quality and performance. The efficiency of the hybrid algorithm is evaluated by three well-known instance sets. We outperform the benchmarks for most instance sets from the literature. Detailed results and the implementation of loading constraints are published online.},

Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, approximation methods seem to offer the most promise for practical size problems.

The problem set includes routing and scheduling environments that differ in terms of the type of data used to generate the problems, the percentage of customers with time windows, their tightness and positioning, and the scheduling horizon. We found that several heuristics performed well in different problem environments; in particular an insertion-type heuristic consistently gave very good results.},

@article{zhang_learning-based_2022,
  abstract     = {A capacitated vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints is addressed. Associated with each customer are a set of rectangular items, the total weight of the items, and a time window. Designing exact algorithms for the problem is very challenging because the problem is a combination of two {NP}-hard problems. An exact branch-and-price algorithm and an approximate counterpart are proposed to solve the problem. We introduce an exact dominance rule and an approximate dominance rule. To cope with the difficulty brought by the loading constraints, a new column generation mechanism boosted by a supervised learning model is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of integrating the learning model in terms of {CPU} time and calls of the feasibility checker. Moreover, the branch-and-price algorithms are able to significantly improve the solutions of the existing instances from literature and solve instances with up to 50 customers and 103 items.
                  Summary of Contribution: We wish to submit an original research article entitled ‚ÄúLearning-based branch-and-price algorithms for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and two-dimensional loading constraints‚Äù for consideration by {IJOC}. We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere, nor is it currently under for publication elsewhere. In this paper, we report a study in which we develop two branch-and-price algorithms with a machine learning model injected to solve a vehicle routing problem integrated the two-dimensional packing. Due to the complexity brought by the integration, studies on exact algorithms in this field are very limited. Our study is important to the field, because we develop an effective method to significantly mitigate computational burden brought by the packing problem so that exactness turns to be achievable within reasonable time budget. The approach can be generalized to the three-dimensional case by simply replacing the packing algorithm. It can also be adapted for other {VRPs} when high-dimensional loading constraints are concerned. Broadly speaking, the study is a typical example of adopting supervised learning to achieve acceleration for operations research algorithms, which expands the envelop of computing and operations research. Hence, we believe this manuscript is appropriate for publication by {IJOC}.},

  abstract     = {Three-Dimensional Packing Problems (3D-{PPs}) can be applied to effectively reduce logistics costs in various areas, such as airline cargo management and warehouse management. In general, 3D-{PP} studies can be divided into two different streams: those tackling the off-line problem, where full knowledge about items is available beforehand; and those tackling the on-line (real-time) problem, where items arrive one by one and should be packed immediately without having full prior knowledge about them. During the past decades, off-line and on-line 3D-{PPs} have been studied in the literature with various constraints and solution approaches. However, and despite the numerous practical applications of on-line problems in real-world situations, most of the literature to date has focused on off-line problems and is quite sparse when it comes to on-line solution methods. In this regard, and despite the different nature of on-line and off-line problems, some approaches can be applied in both environments. Hence, we conducted an in-depth and updated literature review to identify and structure various constraints and solution methods employed by researchers in off-line and on-line 3D-{PPs}. Building on this, by bringing together the two separate streams of the literature, we identified several off-line approaches that can be adopted in on-line environments. Additionally, we addressed relevant research gaps and ways to bridge them in the future, which can help to develop this research field.},

  abstract     = {Online 3D Bin Packing Problem (3D-{BPP}) has a wide range of industrial applications and there is an emerging research interest in learning optimal bin packing policy and deploying it for real logistics applications. From the heuristic methods to the deep reinforcement learning ({DRL}) methods, the previous works have proposed many solutions to solve the online 3D-{BPP}. However, none of them have studied what and how heuristics can be modelled into {DRL} to build a more effective and practical bin packing pipeline. In this work, we thoroughly investigate what heuristics can be used in online 3D-{BPP} and how to effectively integrate the heuristics with the {DRL}. First, we design 3 different heuristics based on the physical rules of the real world and the experiences of the human packers, including the Physics-Heuristics, the Packing-Heuristics and the Unpacking-Heuristics. Second, we model the 3 types of heuristics into the {DRL} framework and propose a novel heuristic {DRL} method to solve the online 3D-{BPP}. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art bin packing performance and the resulting real-world system is able to reliably finish the bin packing task in real logistics scenarios. Supplementary video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8GpmEELq18. Note to Practitioners‚ÄîThe rapid growth of e-commerce has significantly increased the burden of human packers in logistic warehouses, where the workers need to pick the products from a conveyor and pack them into bins (i.e. the online 3D bin packing). Thus it is of great importance to develop intelligent robotic systems to replace human labor, which is a long-standing topic in the field of control and automation science. This paper makes a substantial contribution to the related field by studying the online 3D bin packing in terms of both the theory and practice. On the one hand, the simulated experiments suggest that the presented algorithm significantly improves the space utilization of bin packing. On the other hand, the robotic system developed based on the proposed method can favourably finish the bin packing task in real logistics scenarios, demonstrating the practical use of our approach. Consequently, the approach proposed in this paper is totally applicable in logistic warehouses and is promising to drastically improve the working efficiency of the product packing in real warehouses. In the future, we will extend the presented approach to pack irregular-shaped objects and then facilitate more logistics applications.},

@article{zhang_gan-based_2024,
  abstract     = {The 3D bin packing problem is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem with numerous real-world applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for solving this problem by integrating a generative adversarial network ({GAN}) with a genetic algorithm ({GA}). Our proposed {GAN}-based {GA} utilizes the {GAN} to generate high-quality solutions and improve the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the {GA}. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a set of benchmark instances and compare it with two existing algorithms. The simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms both existing algorithms in terms of the number of used bins while achieving comparable computation times. Our proposed algorithm also performs well in terms of solution quality and runtime on instances of different sizes and shapes. We conduct sensitivity analysis and parameter tuning simulations to determine the optimal values for the key parameters of the proposed algorithm. Our results indicate that the proposed algorithm is robust and effective in solving the 3D bin packing problem. The proposed {GAN}-based {GA} algorithm and its modifications can be applied to other optimization problems. Our research contributes to the development of efficient and effective algorithms for solving complex optimization problems, particularly in the context of logistics and manufacturing. In summary, the proposed algorithm represents a promising solution to the challenging 3D bin packing problem and has the potential to advance the state-of-the-art in combinatorial optimization.},

Deep Reinforcement Learning is a potential solution to solve more complex problems by introducing artificial neural networks in Reinforcement Learning. In this paper, a game engine was used for Deep Reinforcement Learning training, which allows visualization of view learning and result processes more intuitively than other tools, as well as a physical engine for a more realistic problem-solving environment. The present research demonstrates that a Deep Reinforcement Learning model can effectively address the real-time sequential 3D bin packing problem by utilizing a game engine to visualize the environment.

  abstract     = {Because of continuous competition in the corporate industrial sector, numerous companies are always looking for strategies to ensure timely product delivery to survive against their competitors. For this reason, logistics play a significant role in the warehousing, shipments, and transportation of the products. Therefore, the high utilization of resources can improve the profit margins and reduce unnecessary storage or shipping costs. One significant issue in shipments is the Pallet Loading Problem ({PLP}) which can generally be solved by seeking to maximize the total number of boxes to be loaded on a pallet. In many previous studies, various solutions for the {PLP} have been suggested in the context of logistics and shipment delivery systems. In this paper, a novel two-phase approach is presented by utilizing a number of Machine Learning ({ML}) models to tackle the {PLP}. The dataset utilized in this study was obtained from the {DHL} supply chain system. According to the training and testing of various {ML} models, our results show that a very high ({\textgreater}85\%) Pallet Utilization Volume ({PUV}) was obtained, and an accuracy of {\textgreater}89\% was determined to predict an accurate loading arrangement of boxes on a suitable pallet. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of all the results on the basis of a comparison of several {ML} models is provided in order to show the efficacy of the proposed methodology.},

@article{yang_large_2025,
  abstract     = {The multi-container loading problem is a practical problem commonly faced by manufacturing and logistics industries. Solving this problem can effectively improve transportation efficiency and reduce logistics costs. In the current production process, the strong heterogeneity of items, containers and the large order size pose significant challenges to the generation of loading solutions. In this study, we propose a heuristic packing algorithm and a novel Q-learning-based large neighborhood search ({QLNS}) algorithm to solve this problem in acceptable time. Specifically, the items are selected and packed into containers based on the heuristic packing algorithm, and the tail-packing strategy is designed to optimize the criterion for container selection in the final stage of packing. The {QLNS} algorithm is proposed to improve the initial loading solution generated by the heuristic packing algorithm. Unlike traditional random or adaptive selection of operators, this algorithm designs three features as the state of the solution, and chooses a pair of destroy-repair operators under the guidance of a trained agent. Compared with the other two approaches, this approach is more targeted to improve the loading solution. In addition, a prioritized experience replay mechanism is introduced to assist in the training of the agent. Experiments on real-world instances demonstrate that our algorithms can obtain satisfactory loading solutions for different scales of items within a specified time and outperforms other existing large neighborhood search algorithms.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents a new branch-and-cut algorithm based on infeasible path elimination for the three-dimensional loading capacitated vehicle routing problem (3L-{CVRP}) with different loading problem variants. We show that a previously infeasible route can become feasible by adding a new customer if support constraints are enabled in the loading subproblem and call this the incremental feasibility property. Consequently, different infeasible path definitions apply to different 3L-{CVRP} variants and we introduce several variant-depending lifting steps to strengthen infeasible path inequalities. The loading subproblem is solved exactly using a flexible constraint programming model to determine the feasibility or infeasibility of a route. An extreme point-based packing heuristic is implemented to reduce time-consuming calls to the exact loading algorithm. Furthermore, we integrate a start solution procedure and periodically combine memoized feasible routes in a set-partitioning-based heuristic to generate new upper bounds. A comprehensive computational study, employing well-known benchmark instances, showcases the significant performance improvements achieved through the algorithmic enhancements. Consequently, we not only prove the optimality of many best-known heuristic solutions for the first time but also introduce new optimal and best solutions for a large number of instances.},

  abstract     = {Location-routing, inventory-routing, multi-echelon routing, routing problems with loading constraints are classes of problems that are receiving increasing attention in the scientific community. Problems in these classes generalize classical vehicle routing problems enlarging the decision space to optimize a broader system. The resulting problems are computationally harder to solve but offer opportunities to achieve remarkable additional savings. In this paper, we address the issue of quantifying the potential benefit deriving from tackling directly such complex problems instead of solving the individual problems in a not integrated manner. To this aim, we consider as a proof of concept the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem ({CVRP}) with Two-dimensional Loading constraints (2L-{CVRP}), a variant of the {CVRP} where rectangular-shaped items have to be delivered to customers and loading constraints have to be satisfied. We consider the 2L-{CVRP} in an integrated manner and compare the solutions with those obtained from three not integrated approaches based on addressing separately the routing and the loading problems. The importance of an integrated approach for the 2L-{CVRP} is validated through the study of the worst-case performance of the not integrated approaches, and conducting computational experiments on benchmark and new instances.},

We propose a hybrid solution approach incorporating the rationale of two well-known metaheuristics which have proven to be effective for routing problem variants, namely tabu search and guided local search. The intelligence of the proposed hybrid was designed to achieve a vast exploration of the search space, by escaping from local optima and intensifying at promising solution regions. The performance of our metaheuristic algorithm was tested on benchmark instances involving from 50 to 400 customers.

A new heuristic based on the wall-building approach is proposed, which decomposes the problem into a number of layers which again are split into a number of strips. The packing of a strip may be formulated and solved optimally as a Knapsack Problem with capacity equal to the width or height of the container. The depth of a layer as well as the thickness of each strip is decided through a branch-and-bound approach where at each node only a subset of branches is explored. Several ranking rules for the selection of the most promising layer depths and strip widths are presented and the performance of the corresponding algorithms is experimentally compared for homogeneous and heterogeneous instances. The best ranking rule is then used in a comprehensive computational study involving large-sized instances. These computational results show that instances with a total box volume up to 90\% easily may be solved to optimality, and that average fillings of the container volume exceeding 95\% may be obtained for large-sized instances.},

Therefore, the load on axles should be already considered during the planning phase and thus before loading the truck in order to prevent overloading.

We model the Axle Weight Constraint for trucks with and without trailers based on the Science of Statics and provide flexible formulas for different axle configurations of trucks. We include the Axle Weight Constraint into the combined Vehicle Routing and Container Loading Problem (‚Äú2L-{CVRP}‚Äù and ‚Äú3L-{CVRP}‚Äù). A hybrid heuristic approach is used where an outer Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search tackles the routing problem and an inner Deepest-Bottom-Left-Fill algorithm solves the packing problem. Moreover, to ensure feasibility, we show that the Axle Weight Constraint must be checked after each placement of an item. The impact of the Axle Weight Constraint is also evaluated.},
