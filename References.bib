  abstract     = {Container loading is a pivotal function for operating supply chains efficiently. Underperformance results in unnecessary costs (e.g. cost of additional containers to be shipped) and in an unsatisfactory customer service (e.g. violation of deadlines agreed to or set by clients). Thus, it is not surprising that container loading problems have been dealt with frequently in the operations research literature. It has been claimed though that the proposed approaches are of limited practical value since they do not pay enough attention to constraints encountered in practice. In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art in the field of container loading will be given. We will identify factors which ‚Äì from a practical point of view ‚Äì need to be considered when dealing with container loading problems and we will analyze whether and how these factors are represented in methods for the solution of such problems. Modeling approaches, as well as exact and heuristic algorithms will be reviewed. This will allow for assessing the practical relevance of the research which has been carried out in the field. We will also mention several issues which have not been dealt with satisfactorily so far and give an outlook on future research opportunities.},

  abstract     = {We consider a special case of the symmetric capacitated vehicle routing problem, in which a fleet of K identical vehicles must serve n customers, each with a given demand consisting in a set of rectangular two-dimensional weighted items. The vehicles have a two-dimensional loading surface and a maximum weight capacity. The aim is to find a partition of the customers into routes of minimum total cost such that, for each vehicle, the weight capacity is taken into account and a feasible two-dimensional allocation of the items into the loading surface exists.
                  The problem has several practical applications in freight transportation, and it is ùí©ùí´-hard in the strong sense. We propose an exact approach, based on a branch-and-cut algorithm, for the minimization of the routing cost that iteratively calls a branch-and-bound algorithm for checking the feasibility of the loadings. Heuristics are also used to improve the overall performance of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by means of computational results.},

                  Given automated order systems, detailed characteristics of items and vehicles enable the detailed planning of deliveries including more efficient and safer loading of distribution vehicles. Many vehicle routing approaches ignore complex loading constraints. This paper focuses on the comprehensive evaluation of loading constraints in the context of combined Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem and 3D Loading (3L-{CVRP}) and its extension with time windows (3L-{VRPTW}). To the best of our knowledge, this paper considers the currently largest number of loading constraints meeting real-world requirements and reducing unnecessary loading efforts for both problem variants. We introduce an approach for the load bearing strength of items ensuring a realistic load distribution between items. Moreover, we provide a new variant for the robust stability constraint enabling better performance and higher stability. In addition, we consider axle weights of vehicles to prevent overloaded axles for the first time for the 3L-{VRPTW}. Additionally, the reachability of items, balanced loading and manual unloading of items are taken into account. All loading constraints are implemented in a deepest-bottom-left-fill algorithm, which is embedded in an outer adaptive large neighbourhood search tackling the Vehicle Routing Problem. A new set of 600 instances is created, published and used to evaluate all loading constraints in terms of solution quality and performance. The efficiency of the hybrid algorithm is evaluated by three well-known instance sets. We outperform the benchmarks for most instance sets from the literature. Detailed results and the implementation of loading constraints are published online.},

Given the intrinsic difficulty of this problem class, approximation methods seem to offer the most promise for practical size problems. After describing a variety of heuristics, we conduct an extensive computational study of their performance. The problem set includes routing and scheduling environments that differ in terms of the type of data used to generate the problems, the percentage of customers with time windows, their tightness and positioning, and the scheduling horizon. We found that several heuristics performed well in different problem environments; in particular an insertion-type heuristic consistently gave very good results.},

@article{zhang_learning-based_2022,
  abstract     = {A capacitated vehicle routing problem with two-dimensional loading constraints is addressed. Associated with each customer are a set of rectangular items, the total weight of the items, and a time window. Designing exact algorithms for the problem is very challenging because the problem is a combination of two {NP}-hard problems. An exact branch-and-price algorithm and an approximate counterpart are proposed to solve the problem. We introduce an exact dominance rule and an approximate dominance rule. To cope with the difficulty brought by the loading constraints, a new column generation mechanism boosted by a supervised learning model is proposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of integrating the learning model in terms of {CPU} time and calls of the feasibility checker. Moreover, the branch-and-price algorithms are able to significantly improve the solutions of the existing instances from literature and solve instances with up to 50 customers and 103 items.
                  Summary of Contribution: We wish to submit an original research article entitled ‚ÄúLearning-based branch-and-price algorithms for a vehicle routing problem with time windows and two-dimensional loading constraints‚Äù for consideration by {IJOC}. We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere, nor is it currently under for publication elsewhere. In this paper, we report a study in which we develop two branch-and-price algorithms with a machine learning model injected to solve a vehicle routing problem integrated the two-dimensional packing. Due to the complexity brought by the integration, studies on exact algorithms in this field are very limited. Our study is important to the field, because we develop an effective method to significantly mitigate computational burden brought by the packing problem so that exactness turns to be achievable within reasonable time budget. The approach can be generalized to the three-dimensional case by simply replacing the packing algorithm. It can also be adapted for other {VRPs} when high-dimensional loading constraints are concerned. Broadly speaking, the study is a typical example of adopting supervised learning to achieve acceleration for operations research algorithms, which expands the envelop of computing and operations research. Hence, we believe this manuscript is appropriate for publication by {IJOC}.},
